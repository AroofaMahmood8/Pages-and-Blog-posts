Pages

Pages are ideal for creating evergreen content within your organization. They are a versatile format for brainstorming, project planning, collaboration, and generating long-term content. With the ability to structure pages hierarchically, you can effectively showcase relationships between different pieces of content, facilitating easy organization and retrieval. In all likelihood, you'll find yourself using pages more frequently than blog posts due to their flexible nature.

Blog Posts

Blog posts are particularly well-suited for disseminating short-lived content. They are perfect for sharing timely announcements, updates, and news items. Presented in chronological order, blog posts can be conveniently accessed from the 'Blog' section located in the space sidebar. Utilize blog posts to swiftly communicate any time-sensitive information or breaking news to your organization, keeping everyone in the loop.
